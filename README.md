# Impress

Innovate 2015 presentation using impress.js

# DXA Impress module

The DXA Impress module adds the impress.js presentation framework into DXA, so you can create and publish presentations directly from SDL Tridion.

The Impress module demonstrates how a DXA module can have its own HTML design, for more details on this, you should take a look at the `impress-html-design.zip` in `100 Master\Building Blocks\Modules\Impress\Admin`
